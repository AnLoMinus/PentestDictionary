# Customization
## Requirements:
- You only need to have Parrot OS installed *(In Kali Linux may work but haven't tested yet)*
- My script install a lot of things that are really useful for pentesting and also for customization *(zsh, kitty terminal, batcat, bspwm...)*
if you have installed more things it won't cause any troubles. I will upload the instaler in a few weeks

Copy this in your ~/.zshrc for changing your cursor

      # Change cursor shape for different vi modes.
      function zle-keymap-select {
        if [[ ${KEYMAP} == vicmd ]] ||
           [[ $1 = 'block' ]]; then
          echo -ne '\e[2 q'
      elif [[ ${KEYMAP} == main ]] ||
           [[ ${KEYMAP} == viins ]] ||
           [[ ${KEYMAP} = '' ]] ||
           [[ $1 = 'beam' ]]; then
        echo -ne '\e[6 q'
      fi
    }
    zle -N zle-keymap-select
    zle-line-init() {
        zle -K viins # initiate `vi insert` as keymap (can be removed if `bindkey -V` has been set elsewhere)
        echo -ne "\e[5 q"
    }
    zle -N zle-line-init
    echo -ne '\e[5 q' # Use beam shape cursor on startup.
    preexec() { echo -ne '\e[5 q' ;} # Use beam shape cursor for each new prompt.
