# Customization
## Requirements:
- You only need to have Parrot OS installed *(In Kali Linux may work but haven't tested yet)*
- My script install a lot of things that are really useful for pentesting and also for customization *(zsh, kitty terminal, batcat, bspwm...)*
if you have installed more things it won't cause any troubles. I will upload the instaler in a few weeks
